# 🤖 Agent Synchronization Log

This file is a shared memory "bulletin board" exclusively used for communication and context handoffs between **Claude Code** and **Antigravity**.

Whenever you switch agents, the incoming agent must read this file to understand the current state, and the outgoing agent must write to this file to document what they just did.

## 🏗️ Current Project State
The user is actively building **Bhao.pk** — a Pakistani price comparison platform (Web App, Mobile App, & Node.js Backend).
- **Recent Focus:** Resilient hybrid Python/Node.js scrapers, UI updates for the search page (grid/list toggle, responsive width, skeleton loaders), and git repository configuration.

## 🛑 Active Blockers & Known Issues
- None currently reported. Scrapers for Daraz and Shophive are active and working via the `.venv` Python environment.

## 📜 Chronological Log (Latest First)

### Entry: 2026-02-21 | Antigravity (Part 2)
**Summary of Recent Work:**
- **Data Cleanup:** Completely removed all hardcoded `fallbackProducts` dummy data from both the Web App (`webapp/app/search/page.tsx`) and Mobile App (`mobile/src/screens/SearchScreen.tsx`). The application now strictly enforces the use of real, live-scraped data from the backend. Implemented proper UI error states for when the backend is unreachable, rather than falling back to mock Macbook/iPhone templates.
**Next Suggested Steps for Claude Code:**
- With dummy data gone, you will need the backend running (`npm run dev` in `/backend`) to view search results. The backend requires Python scrapers to be functional. Focus on making the scrapers for Shophive and Telemart more resilient, or finalize the Mobile App UI.

### Entry: 2026-02-21 | Antigravity (Part 1)
**Summary of Recent Work:**
- **Code Execution / Bug Fixes:** Fixed the Webapp Search Page (`webapp/app/search/page.tsx`). Implemented a responsive full-width layout, added Grid vs List view toggles (with `lucide-react` icons), fixed the store filters logic so options don't disappear when actively filtering, implemented custom pulsing skeleton loaders, and changed product card click routing to point to internal `/product/[id]` pages instead of external links.
- **Styling:** Updated `webapp/app/globals.css` to add the `@keyframes pulse` animation for skeletons and improved the visual contrast, letter spacing, and shadow of the "HOT" and "BEST" `.badge` elements.
- **Dev Workflow:** Migrated the 12 existing `.claude/commands/` skills to `.agent/workflows/` so Antigravity can use them natively. Established this `.agent-sync.md` file.
**Next Suggested Steps for Claude Code:**
- The Webapp search UI is in a great spot, but the backend scrapers (e.g. Telemart, Mega) currently return 404s or are tricky to scrape due to client-side rendering (Algolia/React). Consider investigating alternative ways to scrape those sites or finalizing the Mobile App search UI to match the new features built for the Webapp.
