Chapter 1
Introduction
This chapter introduces the Bhao.pk project, describing its problem statement, objectives, and the technologies used to implement it. It also presents the scope, significance, and development plan of the proposed system. By the end of this chapter, the reader will understand how the project aims to simplify online shopping decisions in Pakistan through intelligent price comparison and alert mechanisms.

1.1. Project Introduction 
Bhao.pk is an intelligent web and mobile platform that aggregates prices of products listed across multiple Pakistani e-commerce sites. It enables users to quickly identify the lowest price for a specific product and receive instant alerts when prices drop below a set threshold. The system collects product and pricing data through automated web scrapers, cleans and normalizes the data, and then displays results on an interactive dashboard.
The project’s core purpose is to give users transparent access to price information that is otherwise scattered across different retailers. A single search query such as “70W USB-C Charger” will return aggregated listings from major online stores like Daraz, Shophive, Mega.pk, PriceOye, and BTech. The backend clusters identical or similar products using fuzzy text matching to eliminate duplicates and inconsistencies.
The platform will also maintain a historical record of price changes, allowing users to visualize price trends over time and set up alerts when prices fall below their target value. The entire system is designed to be cross-platform: the same codebase will generate both a responsive web application and a mobile app.
.
1.2.	Existing Examples / Solutions 

Existing global price comparison systems show that price aggregation is highly valuable for consumers, but none are specialized for Pakistan’s fragmented e-commerce ecosystem.
Google Shopping aggregates product listings from thousands of retailers worldwide, offering side-by-side comparisons and filtering by category or brand. However, it depends on merchant data feeds and lacks real-time integration with local Pakistani stores. Its algorithms are optimized for structured APIs, which limits adaptability to dynamic regional websites.

Idealo, one of Germany’s leading price comparison engines, provides detailed price histories, vendor ratings, and automated alerts when prices change. It uses a mix of API and web-scraping methods but operates exclusively in European markets. While technically advanced, it cannot process PKR pricing or local vendor structures. 
 

Local Attempts in Pakistan include smaller startups and online deal-sharing communities that post offers manually on social media platforms like Facebook or WhatsApp. These efforts lack automation, consistent data collection, and historical tracking. As a result, users must still visit multiple sites individually to verify prices and authenticity.

System/ Platform
Core Functionality
Data Source
Limitations
Unique Value of Bhao.pk
Google Shopping
Aggregates global product listings, enabling real-time price and availability comparison across thousands of retailers.
Merchant-supplied APIs and global data feeds.
No integration with Pakistani vendors; does not support PKR-based pricing.
Serves as a global benchmark for automated product aggregation and intelligent ranking.
Idealo (Germany)
Provides price tracking, vendor ratings, and discount alerts across European retailers.
Retailer APIs and automated web crawlers across EU marketplaces.
Limited to European markets; cannot process PKR or local Pakistani vendors.
Demonstrates how historical price tracking builds trust and empowers consumers.
Local Attempts (Pakistan)
Manual deal sharing through Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram communities.
User-posted, unstructured community data.
No automation, centralized dashboard, or consistent price tracking.
Highlights the need for a unified, automated, Pakistan-specific price comparison ecosystem like Bhao.pk.



 1.3 		Business Scope
Bhao.pk has strong market potential in Pakistan, where online shopping continues to grow but lacks transparent price comparison tools:

   1.3.1	The Intended Audience
	•	Everyday Online Shoppers: Looking for lowest prices without visiting multiple websites.
	•	Students and Budget Buyers: Seeking affordable tech, accessories, or daily items.
	•	E-commerce Analysts: Can study price trends and market volatility.
	•	Retailers: Can analyze competitor pricing dynamically.
  1.3.2	Use in Commercial Settings
	•	Integration into affiliate marketing networks.
	•	Tools for businesses to track competitor prices and adjust strategies.
	•	Integration with fintech cashback or coupon systems.
	•	Academic use in data analytics and information retrieval projects.
  1.3.3	Models of Revenue
	•	Affiliate Commissions: Redirect users to retailers through tracked links.
	•	Ad-Based Revenue: Sponsored listings or priority placement for vendors.
	•	Subscription Plans: Users pay for extended alerts and historical data exports.
	•	API Access: Businesses pay to access aggregated pricing data.
  
1.4. Useful Tools and Technologies 

The development of Bhao.pk relies on a combination of web technologies and data-processing frameworks to ensure smooth cross-platform performance and efficient information retrieval.

The system is built using React with React Native (Expo), which allows both the web dashboard and the mobile application to share the same codebase. This framework ensures responsive interfaces, real-time updates, and reduced development effort compared to maintaining separate apps. 
For backend services, Node.js with Express provides a lightweight, scalable environment capable of handling multiple concurrent API requests efficiently. It manages data flow between the scrapers, database, and user interface, forming the communication core of the system.

Automated data collection is powered by Scrapy and BeautifulSoup, which extract structured product and pricing data from e-commerce websites. These libraries handle HTML parsing, data cleaning, and link traversal, enabling continuous updates without manual input.
 
The project stores and manages information using PostgreSQL, an open-source relational database that supports large-scale data queries, indexing, and time-series analysis. It ensures reliability and fast retrieval for price tracking, user alerts, and historical analytics.

Chapter 2 Requirement Specification and Analysis
Requirements analysis is a process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. These features, called requirements, must be quantifiable, relevant and detailed. In software engineering, such requirements are often called functional specifications. In Chapter 2 we will enlist the functional and non-functional requirements and model functional requirements in the form of use case model.

2.1.	Functional Requirements 
 
A functional requirement defines a function of a system or its component. Functional requirements may be calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing and other specific functionality that define what a system is supposed to accomplish.

2.6. Domain Model 
The Domain Model for Bhao.pk illustrates the conceptual structure of the price comparison ecosystem, centering on the Product entity as the core item being tracked. Each generic product is linked to multiple StoreListings, representing specific offers from external Stores like Daraz or Telemart. Users interact with the system by setting Alerts on these products to monitor price changes. To maintain up-to-date information, a backend ScraperBot creates and updates listings, while a PriceHistory entity logs every price fluctuation over time to support historical trend analysis.

Chapter 3
System Design

The system design of Bhao.pk is built upon a robust, multi-tiered Software Architecture that ensures scalability and clear separation of concerns. It is organized into three primary layers: the Presentation Layer, which handles user interactions via a React-based frontend; the Business Logic Layer, which serves as the core engine managing APIs, the automated Scraping Manager, and the Alert System; and the Database Layer, which ensures persistent data storage using PostgreSQL
3.1. Layer Definition 
 
xv: Table 3.1: Layers Definition
Layers 
Description 
Presentation Layer 
This layer will be used for the interaction with the user through a graphical user interface. 
Business Logic Layer 
This layer contains the business logic. All the constraints and majority of the functions reside under this layer. 
Database Layer 
This layer contains the database of the application being developed. 

3.1.1. Presentation Layer: 
This layer is responsible for the user interface and user experience. It handles user inputs and displays data retrieved from the server. It includes the web frontend (React.js) and potential future mobile interfaces.

3.1.2. Business Logic Layer: 
This layer contains the core functionality. It manages data processing, executes search algorithms, handles scraping scheduling, and processes alerts. It serves as the bridge between the UI and the database.

3.1.3. Database Layer: 
Database layer includes database servers where information is stored and retrieved. Data in this tier is kept independent of application servers or business logic. 
 
3.2. Software Architecture  
This layer is responsible for persistent data storage. It manages the relational database (PostgreSQL) holding information on users, products, stores, and historical price records. Below is the architecture diagram of the system:

3.3. Class Diagram 
The Class Diagram for Bhao.pk defines the system's static structure, centering on the Product class which is composed of multiple specific StoreListings to represent offers from different vendors. Stores act as aggregators for these listings, while Users maintain a strict composition relationship with Alerts, allowing for personalized price monitoring that depends on the user account's existence. Additionally, the diagram illustrates backend automation through the ScraperBot class, which demonstrates a dependency on StoreListings to dynamically create and update price data from external sources.

xvii: Figure 3.2: Class Diagram

User: 
This class represents a user of the Bhao.pk system. It stores essential account information such as userId, email, passwordHash, and their role (e.g., guest or registered). The main responsibilities of this class include managing user authentication via login() and creating new accounts via register().
Alert: 
This class represents a price notification set by a registered user. It holds data including its unique alertId, the user's desired targetPrice, the creationDate, and a boolean isActive status. Its primary operation, checkPrice(), compares a product's current price against the target price to determine if a notification should be triggered.  
Product: 
This is the central entity of the system, representing a generic item that can be sold by multiple vendors. It contains general attributes like productId, title, category, and a baseImage URL. Its key operations include getLowestPrice() to calculate the best available deal and getListings() to retrieve all associated vendor offers. 
StoreListing: 
This class represents a specific offer for a Product from a single Store. It links the general product to a concrete vendor and contains listing-specific details like listingId, current price, the direct vendorUrl to the purchase page, and a lastUpdated timestamp. It includes an updatePrice() operation to modify its price based on new data. 
Store: 
This class represents an external vendor or e-commerce website (e.g., Daraz, PriceOye). It stores identity information such as the storeId, the store's name, its baseUrl, and a logoUrl. 
ScraperBot: 
This class is part of the backend system responsible for automated data extraction. It includes attributes for its botId, the targetDomain it is assigned to crawl, and its execution schedule. Its operations include executeJob() to start the crawling process and extractData() to parse product information from raw HTML. 





3.4. Sequence Diagram 

The Sequence Diagrams for Bhao.pk model the dynamic behavior of the system, illustrating the precise step-by-step message flows between the User, Web Browser, Server, and Database. They provide a detailed blueprint of the logic required to execute core functionalities, such as Searching for Products, Viewing Price History, and Setting Alerts, by visualizing how frontend API requests are processed, validated, and responded to by the backend architecture.

3.6. Database Schema 
The Database Schema for Bhao.pk represents the logical configuration of the relational database, structured around the central Product table which maintains a universal catalog of items. It utilizes a Store_Listings table to bridge these generic products with specific external Stores, allowing the system to manage multiple vendors and prices for a single item. Users are connected to specific products through an Alerts table to manage notifications, while a dedicated Price_History table archives temporal data for every listing to support historical trend analysis
